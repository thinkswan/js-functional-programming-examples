# Functional programming basics in ES6

These examples are taken from Jeremy Fairbank's talk, ["Functional Programming Basics in ES6"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXpOjwYzcs).

# What is functional programming?

It's a paradigm that uses pure functions to build up higher-order functions.

A function simply maps an input (domain) to an output (range).

# Why use functional programming?

- **Predictable:** Pure, declarative functions
- **Safe:** State is immutable
- **Transparent:** State is first-class
- **Modular:** Compose first-class closures

# Functional programming libs

- React
- Redux
- Lodash
- Ramda
